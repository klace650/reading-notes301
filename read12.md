## EJS Partials

*What are partials?*  
    - like functions
    - reusable bundle of code
    - makes it easier to maintain on large sites

Basically makes it simpler to post commonly used elements to many pages using EJS.  
    - Think of headers, nav, footer etc. 
    - Anything that you need recurring on many pages.

Just make a new EJS file for any recurring element - use strawberries like normal EJS.
