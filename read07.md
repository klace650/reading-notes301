## How web works 
    - HTTP protocol written by Roy
    - HTTP part specifies what protocol to use
    - HTTP is like a GPS coordinate for information and knowledge 
- Whole web is architectural style of REST
    - REST: defintion of resource
    Web Page kind of represention of a resource
- URL tells where the concept of the resources are
    - Most resources have a single representation
